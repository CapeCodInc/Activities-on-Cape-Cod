                <h2>Shopping</h2>

            <section>
                <p>Despite all the cute little clothing stores and souvenir shops being closed, there are still <strong>many</strong> other places you can go to shop. For example, Marshalls and Walmart sell a multitude of unique, quality products made by the local community. These hidden gems are the highlight of many cape towns in the winter.</p>

            <section>
                <p>Another <em>special</em> feature about Cape Cod is their roads. This activity is so simple yet so fun. Basically, you just hop in your car and drive on the road. This activity is versatile as well because it could be done solo or with a group of friends. Don't forget to enjoy the barren, desolate landscape as you cruise around!</p>

                <h2>Muddy, Grey Beaches</h2>
            </header>
            <section>
                <p>I bet you thought that going to the beach was only something people did in the summer but hear me out on this one. If you've ever tried to visit our beaches during mid-July then you know that finding a spot is unpossible. But in the winter, you <em>never</em> have to worry about overcorwding. Additionally, if the weather becomes too unbearable, you can always just sit in your car in the beach parking lot.</p>

                <h2>Staying Inside</h2>
            </header>
            <section>
                <p>If shopping, driving, or going to the beach aren't your style, then another great option is just to stay inside. Sometimes, remaining at home is the most fun. You can relax while watching some TV or scrolling on social media, activites that are unique to Cape Cod and <strong>definitely can't be done anywhere else.</strong></p>

            <section>
                <p>I've selfishly saved my <em>favorite</em> winter cape activity for last. By far, I think the best thing to do here in the winter is leave. Like really, there are so many better places you can visit.</p>
